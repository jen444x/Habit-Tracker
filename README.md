# Habit Tracker

A command-line habit tracker that helps you build and maintain habits by tracking daily progress and visualizing your consistency over time.

## Project Evolution

This is **v2** of my progressive Python learning series, building on concepts from previous projects:

- **v1:** [Task Manager](link-to-task-manager-repo) - Python fundamentals and basic CRUD operations
- **v3:** Mood & Habit Correlations _(planned)_ - Will add mood tracking to analyze how habits affect wellbeing

## 🎯 Design Goals

- Build on the solid foundation from v1 (Task Manager)
- Introduce data visualization to make tracking more engaging
- Practice working with time-based data
- Set up structure for v3 where mood tracking will be added

## 🔮 Next Steps (v3)

The next version will add:

- Mood tracking alongside habits
- Correlation analysis (how habits affect mood)
- More advanced visualizations
- Potential machine learning for pattern recognition
